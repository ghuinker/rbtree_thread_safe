INTRODUCTION:
COMS 352 Project 2, Concurrent Red-Black Trees. Created by Gabe Huinker.

Build Instructions:
make

Run Instructions:
./tree <filename>
output is saved to output.txt

Clean Instructions:
make clean

Requirements:
c++ and pthread library

Extra:
* 1 in 100 runs with large data sets may cause a segmentation fault.
    Still looking into this.
* A few threads perform a large amount of the actions.
  I don't know if this is computer specific or implementation.
